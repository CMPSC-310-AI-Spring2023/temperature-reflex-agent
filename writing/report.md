## Arduino Project

Describe the application you have chosen to develop and provide a motivation for why it is a useful application. Include references of all sources you have used throughout this project (URLs are sufficient).

https://bc-robotics.com/tutorials/using-a-tmp36-temperature-sensor-with-arduino/#:~:text=The%20TMP36%20temperature%20sensor%20is,making%20it%20a%20popular%20choice.

The application we've decided to develop is a temperature sensing module. The arduino will use a temperature sensor to monitor ambient temperature, and will alert you via the LED module to let you know if the temperature exceeds a certain range (+/- 10F from 69F).

## Agent

Explain the characteristics/attributes of your agent, what makes it an agent (within the discussed course content), what makes it rational, what type of an agent it is, and what is its environment task (PEAS).

Performance Measure: If the light is on, then the temperature is outside the "room temperature" range.
Environments: Wherever
Actuators: Blinking LED
Sensors: Temperature probe.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

TODO:
Discuss any challenges you have encountered during the work on this lab and describe what have you learned.

## Ethical Benefits and Implications

TODO:
In this section, drawing on class discussions and readings, answer the following questions

1. What entities, businesses, organizations do you envision developing the type of the application you have chosen to develop?

2. Who are the intended users of this technology?

3. Who is not supposed to use this technology?

4. How can the application developed in this lab cause harm?

5. What solutions could be implemented to avoid the harm or to fix the harm described above?

## Team Work

TODO:
Describe the details of your team working strategy, specifically explain how did you complete this work as a team and describe the specific contributions of each team member.
